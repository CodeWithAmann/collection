1.ans: 
The Collection framework in Java is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. It includes:

Interfaces: Abstract data types representing collections (e.g., List, Set, Queue).
Implementations: Concrete classes that implement these interfaces (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet).
Algorithms: Methods that perform operations on collections (e.g., sorting, searching).

2.Ans:-
ArrayList:

Underlying Data Structure: Dynamic array.
Access Time: O(1) for get(index).
Insertion/Deletion Time: O(n) in the worst case (because elements need to be shifted).
Memory Overhead: Less than LinkedList (only stores elements).
LinkedList:

Underlying Data Structure: Doubly linked list.
Access Time: O(n) for get(index).
Insertion/Deletion Time: O(1) if the position is known (because no shifting is required).
Memory Overhead: More than ArrayList (stores node pointers).

3.Ans:-
Iterator:

Can traverse elements in a collection in one direction.
Methods: hasNext(), next(), remove().
Applicable to any collection.
ListIterator:

Extends Iterator, allowing bidirectional traversal.
Methods: hasNext(), next(), remove(), hasPrevious(), previous(), add(), set().
Applicable only to List types.

4.Ans:-
Iterator:

Part of the Java Collections Framework.
Methods: hasNext(), next(), remove().
Allows removal of elements during iteration.
Enumeration:

Legacy interface, used before the Collections Framework.
Methods: hasMoreElements(), nextElement().
No support for element removal.

5.Ans:-
List:

Ordered collection, elements can be accessed by index.
Allows duplicate elements.
Implementations: ArrayList, LinkedList.
Set:

Unordered collection, no duplicate elements.
No index-based access.
Implementations: HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet.

6.Ans:-
HashSet:

Backed by a hash table.
Provides constant-time performance for basic operations (add, remove, contains).
Does not maintain any order.
TreeSet:

Backed by a Red-Black tree.
Provides log-time performance for basic operations.
Maintains elements in natural order (or custom order if a comparator is provided).

7.Ans:-
Array:

Fixed size, defined at the time of creation.
Can store primitives and objects.
Does not provide collection methods like add(), remove().
ArrayList:

Dynamic size, can grow or shrink as needed.
Can only store objects (use wrapper classes for primitives).
Provides collection methods for easy manipulation of elements.
